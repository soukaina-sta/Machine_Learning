This directory contains a collection of projects I have undertaken to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts. 
Each of these projects explores various aspects of machine learning, including classification, regression, clustering, and other related areas.
These projects have been designed to enhance my skills and apply machine learning techniques to diverse datasets.
